A java simulation of 'soft-trait' evolution in humans. (Not backed by any real socioeconomic research)

Here a 'soft-trait' is defined as one that the average person can acquire or improve upon in their life time. These traits currently include strength, intelligence, and altruism. The goal was simply to find any trends of a simple stochastic simulation coorelating to feature inheritance from parents. The main driving force used is an unlabeled currency with arbitrary value. I was interested in the inherit economic 'fitness' of traits combinations that are often attributed as positive attributes in variety of cultures. 

It should be noted that this is not real experiment and is not based on any socioeconomic data, just playing around with concepts for a possible academic approach in the future.
